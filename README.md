Stelpatch is a collection of tools and libraries designed for working with Stellaris mods. It provides functionality for loading, diffing, and patching mods.

## Usage

Refer to the [Releases section](https://github.com/abrenneke/stelpatch/releases) for instructions on how to download and use the latest version of any tools.

### Current Tools

- `moddiff` - Output a summary of the changes a mod makes to the base game

### Building the Code

To build the code from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Stelpatch repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abrenneke/stelpatch.git && cd stelpatch
```

2. If you haven't installed Rust tools, use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust and Cargo

3. Build the code with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build
```

This will create the `stelpatch` binary in the `target/debug` directory.
