- `.mod`, `.gui`, and `.gfx` files anywhere

### Manual Language Selection

If automatic detection doesn't work:
1. Open a file
2. Click the language indicator in the status bar (bottom right)
3. Select "Stellaris" from the list

### Commands

- **Restart CW Language Server**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí `Restart CW Language Server`
- Use this if the language server becomes unresponsive

### Viewing Logs

Check the Output panel for detailed logs:
1. Go to View ‚Üí Output
2. Select "CW LSP Extension" from the dropdown

## Supported File Types

### Game Data Files (`.txt`)
```stellaris
# Buildings
building_example = {
    category = manufacturing
    cost = {
        minerals = 100
        energy = 50
    }
    
    potential = {
        always = yes
    }
}
```

### Mod Files (`.mod`)
```stellaris
name = "My Stellaris Mod"
version = "1.0"
supported_version = "3.6.*"
```

### GUI Files (`.gui`)
```stellaris
guiTypes = {
    containerWindowType = {
        name = "example_window"
        size = { width = 400 height = 300 }
    }
}
```

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.75.0 or higher
- No additional dependencies required (LSP server is bundled)

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. Check if the file is in a `common/` directory or has the right extension
2. Manually set the language to "Stellaris"
3. Restart the language server with `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí `Restart CW Language Server`
4. Check the Output panel for error messages

### Performance Issues

- The language server compiles on first startup, which may take a moment
- Subsequent starts are faster as the server is cached
- Large mod files may take longer to parse
